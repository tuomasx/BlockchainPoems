Blockchain Poems

Blockchain Poems is application made for course Blockchain Development with Smart Contracts with aim to make an application capable of deploying smart contract containing poem, its name and author to blockchain. 

I played with many ideas but settled for poems as they can be stored as strings. Most of the work went into making working working frontend app. I had no prior experience working on frontend so it was a bit of challenge.

Writing the contract was straightforward. Frontend proved to be challenging, and some parts proved to be harder.
